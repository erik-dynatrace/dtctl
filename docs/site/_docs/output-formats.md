title: Output Formats
---

dtctl supports multiple output formats to suit different workflows -- from human-readable tables for interactive use to structured JSON for scripting and AI agents.

## Table (Default)

The default output format is a compact, human-readable table:

```bash
dtctl get workflows
```

```
ID            NAME                     STATE    TRIGGER     LAST RUN
wf-abc123     Daily Health Check       enabled  Schedule    2025-01-15 08:00
wf-def456     Incident Remediation     enabled  Event       2025-01-15 12:34
wf-ghi789     Weekly Report            enabled  Schedule    2025-01-13 06:00
```

## JSON

Output as JSON for scripting and piping to tools like `jq`:

```bash
dtctl get workflow wf-123 -o json

# Pipe to jq for field extraction
dtctl get workflows -o json | jq '.[].name'
```

## YAML

Output as YAML, useful for round-tripping with `dtctl apply`:

```bash
dtctl get workflow wf-123 -o yaml
```

## Wide

The wide format adds additional columns that are hidden in the default table view:

```bash
dtctl get workflows -o wide
```

```
ID            NAME                     STATE    TRIGGER     OWNER            LAST RUN            LAST STATUS
wf-abc123     Daily Health Check       enabled  Schedule    user@example.com 2025-01-15 08:00    SUCCESS
wf-def456     Incident Remediation     enabled  Event       user@example.com 2025-01-15 12:34    FAILED
```

## Describe

The `describe` command renders a vertical key-value view with full detail by default:

```bash
dtctl describe workflow wf-123
```

```
ID:          wf-abc123
Name:        Daily Health Check
State:       enabled
Trigger:     Schedule (0 8 * * *)
Owner:       user@example.com
Created:     2025-01-01 10:00:00
Modified:    2025-01-14 15:30:00
Tasks:       3
```

All `describe` subcommands support the `-o` / `--output` flag to get structured output:

```bash
# JSON output for scripting
dtctl describe workflow wf-123 -o json

# YAML output for round-tripping
dtctl describe slo my-slo -o yaml

# Agent mode envelope
dtctl describe dashboard my-dash -A
```

## CSV

Export as CSV for spreadsheets and data pipelines:

```bash
# Export workflows to a CSV file
dtctl get workflows -o csv > workflows.csv

# Export DQL query results as CSV
dtctl query 'fetch logs | filter status == "ERROR" | limit 100' -o csv > errors.csv
```

## JSON Lines and Parquet (large query exports)

For `dtctl query`, two additional formats are tailored to large result exports:

```bash
# JSON Lines: one compact JSON object per line (newline-delimited JSON).
# Serialised one record at a time and read natively by most local data tooling.
dtctl query 'fetch logs | limit 1000' -o jsonl > logs.jsonl

# Parquet: a columnar binary file, ideal for downstream analytics tooling.
# Pair with a raised --max-result-records when exporting large populations.
dtctl query 'fetch logs' --max-result-records 100000 -o parquet > logs.parquet
```

Notes:

- **`-o jsonl`** has no schema and appends one object per line, so it tolerates
  rows with differing fields. Each record is encoded as it is written rather than
  building the whole result into a single buffer.
- **`-o parquet`** derives its column schema from the DQL column types (it
  requests type information automatically). Nested or variant columns that do
  not map cleanly to a columnar type are stored as a JSON-encoded string column
  rather than being dropped. An empty result still produces a valid Parquet
  file (never a zero-byte file): it carries the DQL schema when types are known,
  otherwise a single placeholder column so the file stays readable by mainstream
  tooling (a column-less file is rejected by DuckDB, pyarrow, and pandas).
- **Parquet files also carry the DQL types in the file footer**, under the
  key-value metadata key `dtctl.dql.types` (a JSON object mapping column name to
  DQL type, e.g. `{"status.code":"long","content":"string"}`). This lets a reader
  recover type information the physical schema alone loses — a Grail `long` is
  stored as `INT64`, but Grail's own JSON serialiser emits it as a quoted string,
  so a consumer reproducing Grail's wire form needs the declared type to know
  which columns to stringify. The footer records **every** declared column,
  including ones that were null in every row (Grail omits null fields from
  records, so such a column has no physical column in the file). Read it with
  DuckDB's `parquet_kv_metadata()` or any Parquet footer reader.

## Column types (`--include-types`)

Pass `--include-types` to surface the DQL per-column type information the query
API returns. In `json` and `yaml` output it appears as a top-level `types` key
alongside `records`, preserving the API's shape (`indexRange` + `mappings`):

```bash
dtctl query 'fetch logs | limit 1' -o json --include-types
# {
#   "records": [ { "content": "...", "loglevel": "INFO", "status.code": "200" } ],
#   "types": [
#     {
#       "indexRange": [0, 0],
#       "mappings": {
#         "content":     { "type": "string" },
#         "loglevel":    { "type": "string" },
#         "status.code": { "type": "long" }
#       }
#     }
#   ]
# }
```

Notes:

- **Only with an explicit flag.** The block is emitted only when you pass
  `--include-types` yourself. `--typed` and Parquet output request the same
  metadata internally to do their work, but that does not add the `types` key.
- **`json`/`yaml` only.** `jsonl` (one record per line) and `csv` (tabular) have
  no place for a document-level sibling, so the block is not emitted there.
- Note the distinction from `--typed` below: `--include-types` reports the
  declared type while leaving values in their wire form (so a `long` still reads
  as `"200"`), whereas `--typed` uses the same metadata to rewrite the values.

## Numeric typing (`--typed`)

The Grail query API deliberately serialises integer-valued columns (`long`,
`duration`) as JSON **strings** to preserve full int64 precision for
JavaScript/TypeScript consumers. dtctl's `json`, `yaml`, and `jsonl` output
faithfully passes that through, so a `count()` reads as `"42"` (a string):

```bash
dtctl query 'fetch logs | summarize c = count()' -o json
# [ { "c": "42" } ]
```

Pass `--typed` to cast scalar columns to their native types using the DQL type
metadata — `long`/`duration` become JSON numbers, `boolean` becomes a real
boolean — so the output is ready for `jq`, pandas, or DuckDB without a
`tonumber` step:

```bash
dtctl query 'fetch logs | summarize c = count()' -o json --typed
# [ { "c": 42 } ]
```

Notes:

- **Opt-in by design.** The default output stays faithful to the API's wire
  encoding. `--typed` implies `--include-types` so the type metadata is
  available.
- **Precision-safe in dtctl.** A `long` is emitted as its full decimal digits,
  unquoted and lossless (never routed through a float). The only precision risk
  is in a downstream consumer that parses JSON numbers as 64-bit floats (browser
  `JSON.parse`, older `jq`) — which is exactly why it is opt-in.
- **Timestamps stay strings.** JSON/YAML have no native date type, so `timestamp`
  columns keep their portable RFC3339 string form. `string`, `ip`, `timeframe`,
  and nested record/array columns are left unchanged.
- Values that do not cleanly parse to their declared type (including non-finite
  doubles such as `"NaN"`/`"Infinity"`, which JSON cannot represent) are left as
  strings rather than failing the output.

## Plain Mode

The `--plain` flag disables colors, progress indicators, and interactive prompts. This is useful for piping output or running in non-interactive environments:

```bash
dtctl get workflows --plain
```

Color output follows the [no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) standard:

- `--plain` flag disables color
- `NO_COLOR` environment variable disables color
- Non-TTY output (piped) disables color automatically
- `FORCE_COLOR=1` overrides TTY detection to force color on

## Command Catalog

dtctl can describe its own commands in machine-readable form:

```bash
# Minimal overview: verbs, resources, subcommands (defaults to TOON, ideal for AI agent bootstrap)
dtctl commands

# Brief catalog: adds mutating status, access levels, flag types, and scopes
dtctl commands --brief -o json

# Full command catalog: descriptions, flag defaults, and global flags
dtctl commands --full -o json

# Human-readable how-to guide in Markdown
dtctl commands howto
```

Unlike other commands, `dtctl commands` defaults to TOON (the most compact format) rather than the table format; pass `-o json` or `-o yaml` to override.

## Agent Mode

The `--agent` (or `-A`) flag wraps all output in a structured JSON envelope designed for AI agent consumption:

```bash
dtctl get workflows --agent
```

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [...],
  "context": {
    "verb": "get",
    "resource": "workflow",
    "suggestions": [...]
  }
}
```

Agent mode is auto-detected when running inside AI agent environments (GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, and others). To opt out of auto-detection:

```bash
dtctl get workflows --no-agent
```

Agent mode implies `--plain` -- no colors and no interactive prompts. See [AI Agent Mode](ai-agent-mode) for full details.

## Pagination

List commands support server-side pagination with the `--chunk-size` flag:

```bash
# Fetch in chunks of 200
dtctl get workflows --chunk-size 200

# Default chunk size is 500
dtctl get workflows

# Disable chunking (fetch all at once)
dtctl get workflows --chunk-size=0
```

All pages are fetched automatically and combined into a single result set.
